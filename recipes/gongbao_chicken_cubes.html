    <p>Trust me, bro.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Must Haves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gochujang</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Anything, really.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Nice To Haves</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Anything, really.</li>
        <li>I personally like the usual garnish ingredients though - green onions, korean chilli flakes, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop anything in any size.</li>
        <li>Stir fry and or boil.</li>
        <li>Add as much Gochujang as you like.</li>
        <li>Make sure to balance the ratio with sugar and soy sauce. Experiment until you get a feel for it. For starters, go for a 1:1:1 ratio to see how that tastes. Adjust later.</li>
        <li>Admire your hellish spicy sweet savory red korean creation and let the salvia build up in your mouth.</li>
        <li>When your salvia begins to drop onto the floor, begin to eat. Enjoy.</li>

        <p><em>side note: be careful with the red sauce, it can ruin everything that has any color but red</em></p>
    </ol>
